# Course Project (Computational Aeromechanics Control of UAV's)
Objective : Design of tricopter for detection of cracks in high rise structures 

# Tricopter Project

- To design and develop a tricopter engineered to meet specific performance requirements: a 30-minute flight endurance while carrying a 200g payload..
- Perfomance estimation involving hover flight using BEMT (Blade Element Momentum Theory) & overall Weight Estimation to estimate the thrust & power required for the tricopter in MATLAB
- Modeled and simulated the tricopter's flight dynamics in Simulink, developing and tuning a PID control loop to ensure stable and accurate motion control.
- Conducted comprehensive structural analysis, including Static and Modal analysis, to verify the structural integrity and dynamic stability of the tricopter airframe.
